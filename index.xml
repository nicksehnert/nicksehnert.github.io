      <description>Should Scott Frost still be the coach at Nebraska? What are Nebraska’s expectations and standards? Do we know? Is Scott Frost being held to the expectations that the fan base and/or Nebraska A.D. Trev Alberts has for the program? At Florida, Dan Mullen was fired after having a 34-15 record over the course of 4 years while Scott Frost has been rewarded another season following a 3-9 record this season and is 15-29 since taking over as the head coach back on December 2nd, 2018.</description>

      <description>A big discussion point this season is how good Nebraska’s Blackshirts were going to be. Heading into their week 0 match up against Illinois, majority of folks believed that since Nebraska returned so many super-seniors they would have little-to-no problem with the fighting Bret Bielemas. Nebraska’s 2009 defense was regarded as one of the best in the country and if they had any sort of offense in 2009, Nebraska would’ve competed for a national championship.</description>
